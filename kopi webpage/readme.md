Hello, if you are seeing this bunch of texts, welcome to the kopi project! 

Overview: 
- I created a simple webpage from a template. This kopi project allows me to see a list of cafes and give ratings to the food, key in a URL for its location, availability of wifi and more. I also created a user-friendly form to add new cafes whenever I find a new cafe easily! Download the project to have a look. 

Skillsets: 
- Using Bootstrap Blocks and super blocks to inherit Bootstrap and standardised CSS styling across all 3 HTML files. 
- Using Jinja templating to run Python code within the HTML files. 
- Routing with Flask by using classes such as render_template, redirect and url_for. 
- Creating a quickform with FlaskForm from flask_wtf. 
- Using SelectField from WTForms to create a dropdown menu. 
- Using Validators and turning off Browser validators. 
- Writing data from quick_form into a CSV file and displaying it on the cafes.html page.
